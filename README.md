# Create Express CLI

A Golang-powered CLI tool to instantly scaffold a ready-to-use **Express.js** application â€” with optional **TypeScript** support â€” so you can skip repetitive setup and jump straight into coding.

# Motivation behind this project
Iâ€™m way too lazy to set up the same Express project every time.  
So instead of doing `npm init` + installing packages + writing the same boilerplate for the millionth timeâ€¦  
So I made this.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Generate a **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** Express app in seconds.
- Preconfigured middleware, routes, and project structure.
- Automatic `npm install` after scaffolding.
- Supports multiple templates (`express-basic`, `express-ts`).
- Clean and maintainable Golang CLI architecture.
